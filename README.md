# ðŸ©º Chest Cancer Classification using Deep Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-powered image classification system to detect and classify chest cancer from medical images. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques to assist radiologists in early diagnosis, improve treatment decisions, and reduce manual diagnostic effort.
The project is designed with a modular pipeline, covering data ingestion, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
